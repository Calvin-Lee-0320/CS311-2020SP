//CS311 Yoshii Linked List class

//INSTRUCTION:
//Must use the provided HW3P1_help.doc to create llist.cpp
//It helps to first create if-then-else structure to fill in later.
//- Make sure PURPOSE and PARAMETER comments are given in detail
//- Make sure all if-then-else are commented describing which case it is
//- Make sure all local variables are described fully with their purposes

//EMACS HINT:
//  You can copy from a Word document to emacs (contrl-right click)
//  cntr-K cuts and cntr-Y pastes
//  Esc x replace-str does string replacements
//  Esc > goes to the end of the file; Esc < to the beginning
//  Tab on each line will indent perfectly for C++
